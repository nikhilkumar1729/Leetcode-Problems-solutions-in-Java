Sort the array in non-decreasing order. 
Loop through each element arr[i] from index 0 to n-2. 
For each arr[i], calculate complement = target - arr[i]. 
Perform binary search for complement in the subarray from index i+1 to n-1. 
If the complement is found, return true. 
If the loop completes without finding any valid pair, return false.
